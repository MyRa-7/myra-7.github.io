# Mythreyi's Website
The source code for the website at https://myra-7.github.io

## Purpose
* The main purpose of this website is not leave the entitled "User Page" blank and to start thinking about what goes here.
* I will, in the near future, update this space with some more things about myself.

## About Me
* I am doing my undergraduate studies in Materials Science and Engineering.
* I am an enthusiast when it comes to nearly everything -> (Note that this may not be a very productive strategy).
* Maybe one day I’ll drown in my curiosity but I'm willing to take the risk. 

> The world is too big to not find anything new to think about every day. The only question is, “Will You?”.
