Hello there!


### First up, who am I?


I am a learner, explorer, optimist, thinker, believer, I could add some more words here but I'm not going to because the idea has been conveyed. I take a lot of pride in appreciating everything that's around. In my opinion, everything that one needs to know is out there waiting for them to find out. So one must just start that journey and never stop learning. That's exactly what I want to do.
